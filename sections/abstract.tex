This thesis examines an on-chip eight-phase clock generator for high-speed Serializer-Deserializer (SerDes) links. Fueled by escalating data-centre traffic and bandwidth-intensive cloud services, next-generation SerDes must exceed 20~GHz while maintaining sub-picosecond timing precision. Conventional approaches such as delay-locked-loop chains, injection-locked ring oscillators and phase-interpolator networks offer useful trade-offs in resolution, jitter and power, yet struggle to scale beyond 10~GHz or demand complex calibration. To overcome these gaps, a programmable delay element (PDE) was implemented in TSMC 3~nm FinFET technology, combining coarse switched-capacitor tuning with fine bias adjustment to generate eight evenly spaced phases from 5 to 22{,}5~GHz. A behavioural Verilog-A calibration loop accelerates simulation and adapts the delay to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) corners.

The research opens with a survey of state-of-the-art multiphase generators and programmable delay circuits, highlighting the limits of current-starved inverters and capacitor-based delay lines. The design methodology covers transistor characterisation, architectural exploration and behavioural modelling. Alternative architectures (switched-capacitor delay elements, feed-forward phase interpolation and supply-bias tuning) were evaluated before converging on a pure delay-line structure with eight independent paths. The generator supplies mid- and low-frequency modes via clock division, while input demultiplexers, output multiplexers and current-limited inverters maintain path selection and residual skew correction.

Circuit simulations report end-to-end jitter below 35~fs and about $1^{\circ}$ phase accuracy at 22{,}5~GHz, satisfying the target specifications. Power consumption is roughly 60~mW in high-frequency mode and drops to about 15~mW in low-frequency mode. The design remains robust across PVT variations and offers a versatile clocking solution for forthcoming SerDes transceivers. Future work will extend fine-tuning resolution with additional control bits and embed the block into a complete transmitter chain.
