This thesis would not have been possible without the help and support of everyone I was lucky enough to meet at the AMD Cork office. I’d like to thank Frantz and Daniele, who gave me critical ideas, great insight, and helped me learn so much throughout the project.

I’m also very grateful to my manager Marc, who was always approachable, helpful, and easy to work with. Declan and Ronan were another big help as experienced engineers who were generous with their time and knowledge, and who treated me as an equal rather than just “the intern.”

The other two interns in Cork, Owen and Conor, deserve a mention too, they definitely made the experience more fun as good friends.

I also want to thank my professor and thesis coordinator, João Goes, for his guidance. Our regular meetings and his feedback, especially after I had a draft ready, were valuable, while still giving me the freedom to work independently.

Thank you to Denise as well, for all the administrative help and for being so kind and welcoming.

Lastly, to my friends back home and abroad, staying in touch with you while I was away meant a lot.
